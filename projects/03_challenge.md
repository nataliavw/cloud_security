# Threat Modelling the Payment Page

## On Threat Modelling

This is the practice of exploring together an application (or a whole deployed
system) to list potential security vulnerabilities, and assess the severity and
likelihood of them. This is usually done by answering to the three following
questions:
1. What are we building?
2. What could go wrong?
3. How can we fix it or prevent it?

You can [use this Miro
template](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM5fZQWg=/?share_link_id=830347769669)
to structure your modelling session as you diagram the system and brainstorm
potential vulnerabilities.

[Here is a video demonstration of a threat modelling session](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hj6Tbpm0H3amdsmGZdxZ1ma-rGgchSPP/view?usp=sharing). Note that this demonstration is not perfect, just like your process will need practice, so don't be too harsh on yourselves for this first one.

## Project

So far, Poochie Pals doesn't handle payments from pet owners to pet sitters. However, the business thought it would be a valuable feature to provide users with a secure and easy payment system (and... Poochie Pals could get a small commission too!).

The engineering team is already planning on building this payment page. They haven't started to implement it yet. They've provided you with a detailed diagram on how they think it will work.

[You can find the diagram here](./poochie-pals-payment-page.png)

Run together a threat modelling session on the payment page application.

Once this is done, [submit your work using this
link](https://airtable.com/appJ1wvInmFyFFYlN/shrvo9ePjlwnaiLv5?prefill_Item=ce_security_02) (make sure to include the names of everyone in your team), 
and reach out to your coach. They'll ask you questions on your diagram, and what
potential security issues you've modelled.
