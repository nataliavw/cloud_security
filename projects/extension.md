# The OWASP Juice Shop

This is an extension project. Only work on this if you've completed all of the above steps in the sequence with your team.

The OWASP juice shop is a codebase maintained by the OWASP online community to help engineers learn about security, and demonstrate some common problems.

It is a larger, realistic web application containing a lot of different vulnerabilities. Some of them are relatively easy to exploit, while some are way more challenging to find, even for experienced engineers.

## How to install

[Follow the setup instructions ("From sources")](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop#setup)

After running the app, you should be able to access the website at http://localhost:3000

## Challenges

You can tackle these challenges in any order. After working on each of them, you can let your coach know, so they can give you feedback.

Then reflect — how likely would it be to have these problems on a "real" website? How could it be prevented before the feature is implemented and deployed to users?

### Leave a review of zero stars

[The contact page](http://localhost:3000/#/contact) allows to leave a customer review to the shop, including a rating of one to five stars.

Using your browser Developer Tools and Networking tools, find a way to leave a review with zero star to the shop.

### Access another customer's shopping basket

Using your browser Developer Tools and Networking tools, find a way to access another customer's shopping basket.

### Threat modelling of the "Forget password" page

Apply the threat modelling process to [the "Forget password" page](http://localhost:3000/#/forgot-password). What could go wrong with this page? How could this be exploited by attackers?

Then, test your assumptions by attempting to exploit these potential threats, if you know how to do it.

### Steal someone's account

Determine the answer to Emma's security question by looking at an upload of her to [the Photo Wall](http://localhost:3000/#/photo-wall) and use it to reset her password via the Forgot Password page.

### Find the hidden scoreboard page

There is a hidden score board on the website, listing the different challenges you've solved. But there's no link to this page! Knowing it exists, can you guess its URL?
