# You've just used something called an "injection".
#
# Whenever users can submit data to your application, there's a potential
# for them to "inject" malicious code. In this specific case, this code was
# some JavaScript. This is called XSS (Cross Site Scripting) injection.
# The browser reads the JS code and executes it.

# In this case we've only showed an alert to the user. Annoying, but pretty
# inoffensive. However, other JS code could be used to redirect the user to a
# different website, run code without them noticing, save cookies in their
# browser, or other things. This could lead to bigger problems.

# In the code below, we've fixed this by escaping the user-submitted input,
# before displaying it in the browser. Generally, any kind of user input can be
# considered "tainted", and potentially harmful â€” it should always be validated
# and sanitised in some way.

# Run this file and try to inject JavaScript code like done previously.
# What's different?
